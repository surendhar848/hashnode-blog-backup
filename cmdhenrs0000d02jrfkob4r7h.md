Hey there, fellow devs, job seekers, and dreamers 👋

I’m Surendhar — (Kandathai podum nanbar) your friend who shares whatever he sees who says things just as they are.

Today is **Day 1** of something I’ve always meant to do — not just chasing a job, but actually documenting my ups and downs, my doubts, my wins, and everything in between on this journey to becoming the kind of developer I truly want to be.

### 🏁 So, what’s special about Day 1?

Honestly? Not much.

I didn’t ship a product. I didn’t get a job. No recruiter messaged me “You’re hired.”  
But still... I showed up today. And **that’s a win**.

Here’s what I did today:

* ✅ Watched the first **10 videos/8** of *Code4Education’s React - Beginner to Advanced* playlist. Felt good to finally get into the groove again.
    
* ✅ Solved a neat little **Java problem**. Baby steps — but each one counts.
    
* 🎵 Took a breather and randomly discovered this absolute gem of a song:  
    *Frangipani (Acoustic)* – Kaber Vasuki  
    Something about it just… hit me. Like it understood the weird mental zone I’m floating in lately.

### 🧠 Dev Brain vs. Distraction Brain

There’s always that inner voice whispering:

> “Bro, time’s ticking — learn Spring Boot also da!”

Today, I shut it down. I told myself:

> “Focus on React first. One thing at a time. No context-switching circus.”

Because truth is, I already know React, Spring Boot, MVC — I’ve touched these before.  
This phase is about **rebuilding my muscle memory**, **refining what I know**, and **getting job-ready**.

### 🤷 Why am I blogging this?

I don’t expect thousands of views. Heck, maybe no one reads this.

But in my head I thought — *even in a vast ocean, if you toss a stone, maybe a fish will notice.*

If **one** developer reads this and thinks,  
**“Hey, same bro. I feel this too.”**  
— then this blog was worth it.

### 🚀 What’s next?

Tomorrow = Day 2. I’ll try to make it more fun. More stories. Maybe some memes.  
This was just the first post — the “let’s break the ice” one.

So until then, this is your **tell-it-like-it-is buddy**,  
**Surendhar** — still jobless, still hopeful, and still grinding. ✌️

One day at a time.  
One commit at a time.  
One blog post at a time.  
Let’s go. 🔥
