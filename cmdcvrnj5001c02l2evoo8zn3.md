I still remember that moment when I was just 6 years old. My mom came to a parent-teacher meeting, and the teacher looked at her and said:

> **“Your son is doing amazing. He has a bright future.”**

I didn’t understand the weight of that back then. But those words stayed with me.

### 📘 From Exams to Expectations

When I was about to write my **10th public exam**, my parents sat me down and said:

> “Get good marks… your life will change. A bright future is waiting.”

I believed them. I worked hard.

The same words echoed again during my **12th exams**. And yes, I made it into one of the best colleges in Tamil Nadu – **Anna University, CEG Campus, Guindy**, where I pursued **Information Technology**.

### 🎓 From Classroom Dreams to Real-World Struggles

Even through struggles, I never stopped learning. I believed effort would bring results.

But **reality hit hard during placements** — I couldn’t get placed.  
Not because I didn’t try, but because **sometimes, even when you do your best, things don’t fall into place.**

> “You’ll have a great life. You’re studying so well!”  
> Everyone used to say that.  
> Now, it feels like **everyone is getting referrals, everyone is moving forward — and I’m stuck**, reaching out to people on LinkedIn, waiting for a response that often never comes.

I don’t have any “influential” connections.  
I’m the **first graduate in my family**.  
So I don’t even know whom to ask.

But is this journey worthless?

**No. Because I haven’t given up.**

### 💻 Still Learning. Still Trying.

Every day, I try to connect with **10 new people on LinkedIn**.

I’m learning different technologies:  
**Java, Python, SQL, React** — anything that gets me closer to my dream.

I’m currently working in a company, but I’m not counted as a full-time employee.

That’s **not enough** for me.

I want to be a true **Software Developer**, contributing to a real product, solving real problems, and growing with a team that values me.

### 🧠 When It Gets Tough…

Yes, I feel frustrated when I hear “**referrals only**” and I don’t get one.  
Yes, sometimes I feel low.  
But **I don’t stop**.

Because I remember who I am —

* A boy who made it from a **government school** to **Anna University**
    
* A learner who didn’t stop even after rejection
    
* A **developer in the making**, chasing every opportunity with full heart and effort

### 🌟 Why This Blog?

This blog is my way of documenting everything:

* What I **learn**
    
* What I **build**
    
* What I **struggle with**
    
* What I **achieve**
    

Because someday soon, I’ll read this first blog again — **with a smile** — after I land my **dream job**.

I’ll know that all of this meant something.

And maybe someone else reading this, going through the same path, will feel **less alone**.
